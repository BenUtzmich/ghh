Configure these values (Use documentation as much as possible, report doc problems to pointdexterish@gmail.com)

in template.php:

in config.php:
$LogType = 'CSV'; //Enter 'CSV' or 'MySQL', then complete the relevant configuration section below
Configure the values below, determined by your type of logging.
Is the logfile writable? Is Register Globals off or disabled in GHH configuration?

Quick Testing
When you view template.php or config.php, it should:
	Make a log. (with correct values, in DB or CSV)
	Display honeypot output. (non-fingerprintable)
	Show no errors. (non-fingerprintable)

To test, configure GHH to write to MySQL and CSV. Report any problems or comments to ryan@thebillygoatcurse.com.
